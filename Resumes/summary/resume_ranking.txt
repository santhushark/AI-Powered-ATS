I'll rank the resume summaries based on the job description requirements, considering experience with LLMs, ML/DL libraries, scalable systems, and specific technical knowledge. I'll score them out of 100, weighing different aspects of the requirements.

Rankings:

1. Karthik Kaiplody: 95/100
Key matches:
- Direct experience with transformers and LLM implementations
- Extensive work with required libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Keras)
- Proven scalability experience (microservice architecture, MLOps pipeline)
- Relevant cloud experience with AWS
- Recent and directly applicable experience

2. Shreesha N Murthy: 90/100
Key matches:
- Strong ML/DL library experience (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Experience with neural networks and transformers
- Scalable systems experience with big data technologies
- Relevant research and implementation experience
- Good mix of theoretical and practical knowledge

3. Prathyush S Parvatharaju: 85/100
Key matches:
- Strong technical background in ML/DL frameworks
- Experience with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
- Scalable systems experience (distributed modeling)
- Deep expertise in neural networks
- Good research background

4. Lakshmi Himaja: 65/100
Key matches:
- Basic ML/Python experience
- Some data analysis experience
- Limited direct experience with required libraries
- No mention of LLM or transformer experience
- Less focused on the specific requirements of the role

The top three candidates show strong alignment with the job requirements, with Karthik having a slight edge due to his direct experience with transformers and LLM implementations. Lakshmi's profile, while strong in general software development, shows less direct alignment with the specific ML/DL requirements of the role.
